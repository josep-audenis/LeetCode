// You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.
// There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit]. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.
// 
// Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after ith query.
// 
// Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.
// 
// - Example 1:
// Input: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]
// Output: [1,2,2,3]
// Explanation:
// After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
// After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
// After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
// After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.
// 
// - Example 2:
// Input: limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]
// Output: [1,2,2,3,4]
// Explanation:
// After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
// After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
// After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
// After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
// After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.
//  
// Constraints:
// 路 1 <= limit <= 109
// 路 1 <= n == queries.length <= 105
// 路 queries[i].length == 2
// 路 0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit

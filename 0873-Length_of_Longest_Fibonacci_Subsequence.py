# A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is Fibonacci-like if:
# 路 n >= 3
# 路 xi + xi+1 == xi+2 for all i + 2 <= n

# Given a strictly increasing array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of arr. If one does not exist, return 0.

# A subsequence is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

# - Example 1:
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].

# - Example 2:
# Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].

# Constraints:
# 路 3 <= arr.length <= 1000
# 路 1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 10^9
